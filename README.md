# D5Basketball
Simple dice game based on basketball.

## Materials
### Lying around the house:
+ 2xD5 (or 2xD6) representing the players by "position"  
+ 1xD6 (distinct from 2xD6 if used) representing a spot on the court, or "zone"  
+ 1xD20 representing Fortune  

### Printed
+ 1x half court  (2x if preferred) - position 1 is under the basket, position 2 covers the remainder of the key  
+ 2 team odds cards  
+ 2 opponent strategy cards   
+ Scorecards (plain paper may be substituted)  

## Types of game
+ 1 player 1 team
+ 1 player 2 teams
+ 2 players  
Each type of game has variations for D5 and D6.

## Setup
Arrange materials any way you like. All materials will be in play on each turn.

## Object of the game
+ 1 player 1 team - score 21 points in as few turns as possible. The fewest possible is 7. Any score under 16 for Team 1 or Team 2 is well played with good fortune.  
+ 1 player 2 teams - score 21 more quickly than opponent  
+ 2 players 2 teams - score 21 more quickly than opponent  

## First turn
+ D5: roll a D5 and the D6. Place the D5 at the zone on the board indicated by the D6.  
+ D6: Place a D6 with the 1 facing up in zone 6 on the basketball court. Roll the other two D6 dice. Place the position die in the zone specified by the zone die. Remove the original position die from the court.
	+ Special rule for D6: If a 6 is rolled, consider that to be player 1.  

## Second turn
+ D5: Roll the remaining D5 with the D6. Place the D5 in the zone specified by the D6.  
+ D6: Roll the remaining player D6 with the position D6. Place the player D6 in the zone specified by the distinct D6.  
	+ Special rule for D6: If a 6 is rolled, consider the player to be the same player that held the ball at the end of turn 1.  

## Subsequently
+ Look up the odds for each player at their position on the odds chart. If both rolls resulted in the same player at the same zone, consider only that player in that zone.  
+ Select one of the shots to take, or select to take a third turn.  
	+ If a shot is selected, remove the unselected player + shot from the court. Roll the D20. A result equal to or less than the number on the chart is considered a made shot.  
		+ Shots made from zones 1-4 score 2 points. Shots made from zones 5 and 6 score 3 points.  

## 3rd turn (if applicable)
+ Throw the D5 or D6 with the distinct D6 and take the shot specified by the result of the roll, following rules above.  
	+ D6 only: If the player die shows a 6, use the player that was selected by turn 2.

Each player's turn ends with a shot, whether made or missed. If there are 2 teams, the teams alternate turns.

## D6 special rule for first turn
+ If the first roll is a pair of 6s, the play is a FAST BREAK. Throw one player die, and select the shot to take from any zone (do not throw the zone die). Take the shot per the rules above.  
  
## The Imaginary Player
Flip a coin to determine which set of strategies will be used. Throw a D6 to determine the strategy that will be used for the entire game and is called the "target". That will be a number 1-20, usually 6-16. After turn 2, if either of the players hits the "target", the player with the higher odds (regardless of zone) will take the shot. If neither player can make the target, take a 3rd turn and follow the rules for a 3rd turn (above).

## Scorecards
The scorecards are optional.  
  
Average playing time for solo game, 1 team, using scorecards, is 10 minutes.  

## Variations
+ Make your own teams.  
+ Cut the player cards and shuffle for each position.  
+ D6: change the role of the 6 position  
	+ On the first roll, a 6-6 is still a FAST BREAK.  
	+ On the first roll, any other position roll of 6 forces any player (of your choosing) to shoot from the zone on the zone die.  
	+ On the 2nd or 3rd roll, a 6 position forces the shot from the most recent player with the ball (see main rules), from the zone specified by the roll.
